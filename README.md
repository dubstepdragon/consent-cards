# Consent Cards

This was a project in an effort to help represent consent in the clearest way possible in VRChat meetups. 

Consent is key among everyone when it comes to social interactions so I made this tool to help people broadcast their intentions in worlds where this tool has been imported.

I ask Kindly that any forks, upgrades or other distributions to this tool maintain the free and open source core of this project. 

## Installation

Then use the Creator Companion to add the tool to your project. 

## How to use

     3. Ctrl click the "Consent Card Manager" and the "Consent Card Manager Menu" and drag them into your scene

        - If it says `Consent Card Manager Missing, please Drag and Drop it Here...` make sure to have the Consent Card Manager in the scene and drag and drop it into that slot.

## Rules for Forking, Contributing, or Redistribution

I ask you don't charge for this tool. As I said above, Consent is Key, I hope this tool will help make it easier for people to broadcast their intentions at meetups, or other situations.

Huge Thanks to [CyanPlayerObjectPool](https://github.com/CyanLaser/CyanPlayerObjectPool). Spent a few days of my time building exactly this tool, that you did better, Consent Cards wouldn't be possible with your tool. 

## Planned updates

- customizable cards, i want to do some cosmetics with the cards so there can he tails horns and so on
- visual toggles, so people can easily turn them on and off bith locally and in the world
- Editor window, for easily putting the tool into your world and changing information for the cards.
- offline uploading, develop a system to allow remote uploading of information so you dont have to re-upload the while world
