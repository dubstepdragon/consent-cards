# Consent Cards

This was a project in an effort to help represent consent in the clearest way possible in VRChat meetups. 

Consent is key among everyone when it comes to social interactions so I made this tool to help people broadcast their intentions in worlds where this tool has been imported.

I ask Kindly that any forks, upgrades or other distributions to this tool maintain the free and open source core of this project. 

## How to use

1. Use the VCC link to add to the Creator Companion
2. Use the Helpful Editor Window to generate the managers, and panels needed. (This is a wip and will be finished in the next update)
   - until the editor window is finished do the following
     1. In Unity Go to Packages/Consent Cards/Runtime/Prefabs
     2. Drag and Drop both the ConsentCardManager and the ConsentCardManagerMenu into the scene
     3. Click on ConsentCardManagerMenu
     4. In the Inspector on the right hand side of unity, drag and drop the ConsentCardManager into the "Manager" Variable    
4. Edit the Details of each of the indicators.
5. Upload your VRChat World!

## Rules for Forking, Contributing, or Redistribution

I ask you don't charge for this tool. As I said above, Consent is Key, I hope this tool will help make it easier for people to broadcast their intentions at meetups, or other situations.
