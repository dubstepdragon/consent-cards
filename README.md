# Consent Cards

This was a project in an effort to help represent consent in the clearest way possible in VRChat meetups. 
Be it 18+ or not, consent is key among everyone when it comes to social interactions. 

Consent is such an important thing this tool will be open, avaiable and free to use for everyone (and I plan to keep it that way)

The only monitization I want to have with this project is donations if you wish to support the project (for that purchase it through gum road and add monatary value)

I ask Kindly that any forks or upgrades to this repo maintain the free and open source idea of this project.
