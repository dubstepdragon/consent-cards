# Consent Cards

This was a project in an effort to help represent consent in the clearest way possible in VRChat meetups. 

Consent is key among everyone when it comes to social interactions so I made this tool to help people broadcast their intentions in worlds where this tool has been imported.

I ask Kindly that any forks, upgrades or other distributions to this tool maintain the free and open source core of this project. 

## How to use

1. Use the VCC link to add to the Creator Companion
2. Use the Helpful Editor Window to generate the managers, and panels needed. (This is a wip and will be finished in the next update)
3. Edit the Details of each of the indicators.
4. Upload your VRChat World!

## Rules for Forking, Contributing, or Redistribution

I ask you don't charge for this tool. As I said above, Consent is Key, I hope this tool will help make it easier for people to broadcast their intentions at meetups, or other situations. 

If you feel you want to donate, I have a gumroad link where you can send money through a storefront to support my development on this tool.
