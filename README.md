# Consent Cards

This was a project in an effort to help represent consent in the clearest way possible in VRChat meetups. 
Be it 18+ or not, consent is key among everyone when it comes to social interactions. 

Consent is such an important thing this tool will be open, avaiable and free to use for everyone (and I plan to keep it that way)

The only monitization I want to have with this project is donations if you wish to support the project (for that purchase it through gum road and add monatary value)

I ask Kindly that any forks or upgrades to this repo maintain the free and open source idea of this project. 

# How to use

1. Add to VCC then add to your project
2. Use the Helpful Editor Window to generate the managers, and panels needed.
3. Drag the main panel where you feel it will work best.
4. The main manager can reside anywhere, the canvas window can be shown hidden or put where you want, it's a local window.
